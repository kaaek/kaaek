# Hi, I'm Khalil El Kaaki

**Junior Computer Engineering Student at AUB, Research Assistant in Post-Quantum Cryptography for IoT**

## Brief

- I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the American University of Beirut focused on offensive security.
- I'm currently looking into a post-quantum password-authenticated key exchange (PQ-PAKE) implementation for the Thread network layer protocol for IoT.
- Beyond academics, I've spent years contributing to **SkillSaff**, a community service project offering college counseling resources, exam materials, and technical tutorials to marginalized public schools in Beirut. After a three-year pause, I'm returning to continue this work soon.
- I approach projects with a start-now mindset: open the editor, write that first bad line of code, and refine as you go. Creativity is fleeting, and implementation can always be cleaned up later.

## Tech Stack

**Programming & Scripting:** Bash, Batch, PowerShell, Python, Java, C/C++, MATLAB, and SQL
**Backend Frameworks & DevOps:** Spring Boot, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Docker

## Pentest Tools I Use

**Reconnaissance & Enumeration:** Nmap, Subfinder, Ffuf/Dirb, WhatWeb, Nikto, Wireshark  
**Exploitation & Vulnerability:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLmap, Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat  
**Post-Exploitation & PrivEsc:** GTFOBins, PEASS-ng  

## Featured Projects

**[UAV-MEC Trajectory Network Optimizer](https://github.com/kaaek/UAV-MEC-Trajectory-Network-Optimizer):** PyTorch project that simulates and optimizes the trajectory of an aerial (UAV) compute edge node to maximize the number of tasks completed for users (optimizing for service.)

**Backend Development Course (In Progress):** Building a Spring Boot curriculum for Java developers covering RESTful APIs, bean validation, HTTP semantics, security hardening, and DevOps integration. I plan to give this course on campus :)

## What I'm up to

- Learning about [cryptography](https://appliedcryptography.page/#resources) and [formal verification](https://danieldia-dev.github.io/proofs/).
- I'm taking Ethical Hacking II in uni this semester which focuses on Windows hacking, active directory attacks, malware development, among other topics.
