# Hi, I'm Khalil El Kaaki

**Research Assistant in Post-Quantum Cryptography | Computer Engineering @ AUB**

## About Me

- I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the American University of Beirut
- I'm driven by a focus on security: penetration testing, cryptography, and research & development.
- I approach projects with a start-now mindset: open the editor, write that first imperfect line, and refine as you go. Creativity is fleeting, and implementation can always be cleaned up later.
- My current work centers on post-quantum cryptography research.
- My interests span the full security landscape: from penetration testing engagements and exploit development to SOC operations, malware analysis, and formal verification.
- Beyond academics, I've spent years contributing to **SkillSaff**, a community service project offering college counseling resources, exam materials, and technical tutorials to marginalized public schools in Beirut. After a three-year pause, I'm returning to continue this work soon.

## Tech Stack

**Programming & Scripting:** Bash, Python, Java, SQL, C/C++, MATLAB  
**Reconnaissance & Enumeration:** Nmap, Subfinder, Ffuf/Dirb, WhatWeb, Nikto, Wireshark  
**Exploitation & Vulnerability:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLmap, Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat  
**Post-Exploitation & PrivEsc:** GTFOBins, PEASS-ng  
**Infrastructure & DevOps:** Spring Boot, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Docker

## Featured Projects

**[UAV-MEC Trajectory Network Optimizer](https://github.com/kaaek/UAV-MEC-Trajectory-Network-Optimizer):** PyTorch project that simulates and optimizes the trajectory of an aerial (UAV) compute edge node to maximize the number of tasks completed for users (optimizing for service.)

**Backend Development Course (In Progress):** Building a Spring Boot curriculum for Java developers covering RESTful APIs, bean validation, HTTP semantics, security hardening, and DevOps integration.

## Current Focus

- Strengthening foundations in cryptography and formal verification
- Gaining hands-on experience in SOC operations and malware analysis
- Preparing for graduate programs in security research
- Seeking internship opportunities in penetration testing and applied cryptography
