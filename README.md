# Hi, I'm Khalil El Kaaki

**Research Assistant in Post-Quantum Cryptography, Computer Engineering Student @ AUB**

## About Me

- I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the American University of Beirut.
- I'm driven by a focus on security: penetration testing, cryptography, and research.
- I approach projects with a start-now mindset: open the editor, write that first imperfect (or even bad) line, and refine as you go. Creativity is fleeting, and implementation can always be cleaned up later.
- I'm currently looking into a post-quantum password-authenticated key exchange (PQ-PAKE) implementation for the Thread network layer protocol for IoT.
- My interests span the full security landscape: penetration testing engagements, SOC operations, malware development, analysis, and formal verification.
- Beyond academics, I've spent years contributing to **SkillSaff**, a community service project offering college counseling resources, exam materials, and technical tutorials to marginalized public schools in Beirut. After a three-year pause, I'm returning to continue this work soon.

## Tech Stack

This is as an exhaustive list as I can come up with. Here goes.

**Programming & Scripting:** Bash, Python, Java, C/C++, MATLAB, and SQL (yes, it's a programming language as it is turing-complete.)  
**Reconnaissance & Enumeration:** Nmap, Subfinder, Ffuf/Dirb, WhatWeb, Nikto, Wireshark  
**Exploitation & Vulnerability:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLmap, Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat  
**Post-Exploitation & PrivEsc:** GTFOBins, PEASS-ng  
**Backend Frameworks & DevOps:** Spring Boot, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Docker

## Featured Projects

**[UAV-MEC Trajectory Network Optimizer](https://github.com/kaaek/UAV-MEC-Trajectory-Network-Optimizer):** PyTorch project that simulates and optimizes the trajectory of an aerial (UAV) compute edge node to maximize the number of tasks completed for users (optimizing for service.)

**Backend Development Course (In Progress):** Building a Spring Boot curriculum for Java developers covering RESTful APIs, bean validation, HTTP semantics, security hardening, and DevOps integration. I plan to give this course on campus :)

## Current Focus

- Learning about [cryptography](https://appliedcryptography.page/#resources) and [formal verification](https://danieldia-dev.github.io/proofs/).
- I'm taking Ethical Hacking II this semester, which focuses on Windows hacking, active directory attacks, malware development, among other topics.
- I'm also taking DevSecOps, and I'm learning AWS for now.
- Preparing (as much as I can) for graduate programs in security research
- **Seeking internship opportunities in penetration testing or applied cryptography**
